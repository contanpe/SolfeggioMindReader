# SolfeggioMindReader
I wrote a test program using DeepSeek and a custom LLM prompt that theoretically reads physiological response and emotions by using a microphone through classifying Hz peaks in speech.

## WHAT IT DO:
This program detects the ratio of Solfeggio frequencies in human speech through microphone in real time and with custom length of sample, along with 2 others. A diagnostic tool for schizos.
Know if your local politician is lying! See the green bar! If green is low, they're a psychopath!

Bars are color coded per "chakra" or neuron/endocrine group, and the 432Hz and 440Hz bars are there to be open to interpretation. 
You can also analyze music with it!

## INTERFACE:
- The program uses the default microphone in your pc.
- The top left panel shows db. Use it as a guide to see if its picking anything up.
- The lower left panel shows a guide of Hz captured in real time.
- The bottom text is a live feedback on frequencies being captured.
- The right panel is the reading space.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Press the ENTER key to take a reading. It will take a reading from when the key was last pressed. That way you can control how long it records for.
2. See the bars!

# INTERPRETATION (not scientific, for entertainment or experimental purposes only):

# KEY FEATURES AND USAGE TIPS
## Calibration:
Bars are amplified by ~20% to emphasize differences. A "low" bar may still reflect minor activity.
432Hz (Green) and 440Hz (Red) are subjective markers ("good" vs. "bad")—interpret cautiously.
## Examples:
- A low 432Hz (Green) + high 440Hz (Burgundy) might flag performative or insincere rhetoric.
- High 741Hz (Violet) could indicate calculated messaging.
## For Music/Media:
- Classical/meditative tracks may spike 432Hz, 741Hz and 963Hz.
- Aggressive genres (metal, hip-hop) might elevate 174Hz, 528Hz and 440Hz.

# PROOF OF EFFECTIVENESS
This is from a lecture from 10 minutes of Trump's speech during his inauguration day.
Apparently the lecture can bypass lying and reveals the person's inner physiological response, regardless of what is acted. Fed with the numerical values of the bars.

## Analysis:
Endocrine Correlations:
Stress Hormones (Cortisol/Adrenaline): Dominant peaks in upper frequencies (741Hz, 963Hz) and suppressed grounding frequencies (Root/Heart chakras) hypothetically align with heightened sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation.  Elevated cortisol and adrenaline levels—common during high-stress  scenarios like testimony—could drive hyper-vigilance, cognitive focus,  and emotional detachment.

Oxytocin & Relational Stress:  The 639Hz (Heart Chakra) peak might loosely correlate with  oxytocin-driven social bonding efforts, but chronic stress can suppress  oxytocin, exacerbating relational tension.

Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Dynamics:
Sympathetic Overdrive:  High 741Hz (Throat) and 963Hz (Crown) could mirror SNS  dominance—prioritizing alertness, communication, and ideation over  emotional processing. This aligns with the "fight-or-flight" state,  where logical reasoning and performance override vulnerability.

Parasympathetic Suppression: Low Root (174Hz=0) and Heart (432Hz=10) frequencies might reflect impaired parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) function, hindering  emotional regulation and grounding. Chronic SNS activation can  dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, perpetuating  stress cycles.

Neuroendocrine Feedback Loops:
Cognitive-Emotional Dissonance:  The mismatch between high Crown/Throat activity and low Heart/Root  engagement could symbolize a stress-induced disconnect between rational  narratives (prefrontal cortex) and limbic/emotional processing  (amygdala). Prolonged stress may impair integration between these  systems.
